This is a simple python script that generates a JSON document which is used
to represent the cyber intelligence data contained within the McAfee Intelligence
report entitled:
* "Malicious Document Targets Pyeongchang Olympics"

A copy of the report is available here:
* https://www.threatminer.org/_reports/2018/Malicious%20Document%20Targets%20Pyeongchang%20Olympics%20_%20McAfee%20Blogs.pdf

Wanted to put together a starting point for discussing the object model, so I
felt this was a great place to begin.
